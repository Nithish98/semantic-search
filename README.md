# Stackoverflow semantic-search

Since stack overflow is one of the largest Q&A platforms there are lots of data for every query, this huge amount of information makes it difficult to search for the solution that one is looking for. someone who is new to programing, it is not easy to find optimal answers to their queries when search engine results are based only on words used in search query and not based on semantic similarity.

Search engine which takes minutes to results is also not acceptable, therefore an optimized semantic search engine with scalability is necessary to tackle the problem. Given any query our search engine should return questions and answers related to question that are semantically similar in a small window.
